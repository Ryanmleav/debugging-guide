## How to find your developer console

Many browsers contain a developer console that will allow you to see the result of console.logs, as well as see errors and warnings in your code. While at DevMountain, it's recommended that you use Google Chrome, as it has a wide variety of developer tools that are simple and easy to use. To find your developer console, right click in your web browsers viewport and click the 'inspect' button. You can also use the hotkeys: command + option + j for Mac, control + shift + j for Windows and Linux.
